# Customizable pumpkin mug, upcycling nutella glass

Pumpkin mug that uses nutella glass (200g size).

Pumpkin slices are randomized to make it more realistic (you can disable this by setting seed=0)

# UPDATE

- Add a "beautiful" smile to the Pumpkin and select on which side of the mug it is

## customizable variables

- `slices`: number of pumpkin slice (lobe)
- `PumpkinOnHandle`: put a little pumpkin on the handle
- `PumpkinFaceOrientation`: on which side of the mug the face of the pumpkin is : [0:right, 270:front, 180:left]
- `seed`:  random seed, if you set seed=0 the slice are not randomized
- `debug`: cut a quarter in the mug and display the nutella glass

## nutella glass

It uses a nutella 200g.

If you pour hot beverage in the glass when it cools down it may be stuck in the mug, so put hot water in it to detach it
