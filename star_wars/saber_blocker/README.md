# Light saber blocker

On some cosplay you buy on the internet you have a pocket on the belt with a hole to put your lightsaber. (see the
image)
But after a few try the lightsaber enlarge the hole and goes through it.
So I create a part that you put in the poket to stop the whole light saber going through the hole.

## UPDATE

- v1 Twist

## customizable variables

- `d`: whole part curve (diameter)
- `h`; height of the part
- `l`: length of the part
- `thickness`: thickness of the tube
- `tolerence`: tolerence, space between the tube and blade
